# Sensitive Data Detector

This directory contains the implementation of the sensitive data detector using Python. The detector analyzes input data to identify sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sensitive-data-detector/detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Running the Detector**
   You can run the detector script directly or integrate it with the Node.js backend. To run it directly:
   ```bash
   python detector.py
   ```

## Usage

The detector can be used as a standalone script or as part of a larger application. When integrated with the Node.js backend, it listens for requests containing data to analyze.

### Example

To use the detector, send a POST request to the backend endpoint with the data you want to analyze. The backend will communicate with this Python script to process the data and return the results.
